SnakeTopia is the classic game of snake with some more personalized
feature options. The game consists of the ability to change your snakes
color ("Snake" dropdown) and what environment ("Background" dropdown) 
you want to play in. The object of the game is to eat all the random 
appearing apples to increase the length of the snake. Running into the
snake’s own body or outside the frame of the environment is an automatic
loss. The game is won when the snake is covering the entirety of the board.
